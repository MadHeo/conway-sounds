# The sound that the Conway's Game of Life makes

The Conway's game is philosophical and send a profound message. (at least for me)

I was curious about the sounds the game made, and i made it.

The sound that cells make is mysterious.

# How it works

1. Each cell was numbered.
2. When a cell becomes black, the frequency(hz) matching the cell number is played.
3. When you click the "Change Sound" button, the waveform of the frequency changes. It makes a different sound.
4. I set the default sound to the lowest. If you can't hear it, turn up the volume.
